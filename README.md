# Photography_portfolio

This is a HTML,Css and Javascript project. This is a portfolio website for a photographer to display his work. In this project I have used image carousel to display background images with timer. I have also incorporated aos library for scroll animation. I have used bootstrap for styling and font awesome for icons. This is a responsive website and suitable for desktop, tablet or mobile use.
